# Domain Layer

This will contain all entities, enums, exceptions, types and logic specific to the domain.

The Entity Framework related classes are abstract, and should be considered in the same light as .NET Core.

## Overview

* 📌 Entities
* 📌 Value Objects
* 📌 Enumerations
* 📌 Logic
* 📌 Exceptions

## Key Points

* ✅ Avoid using data annotations;
* ✅ Use value objects where appropriate;
* ✅ Initialise all collections & use private setters;
* ✅ Create custom domain exceptions.
